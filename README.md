💈 Barber Shop Booking Workflow (AI-Powered Automation)
🧠 Overview

This project is an AI-powered Booking Workflow designed for a Barber Shop website chatbot.
It automates the entire appointment booking process — from client submission to owner approval and email notifications — ensuring a smooth, real-time, and professional experience for both customers and the shop owner.

⚙️ How It Works

Client Interaction via Chatbot

The client provides:

Full Name

Email Address

Phone Number

Desired Booking Date & Time

Once all details are submitted, the chatbot replies instantly:

“Thank you for booking a slot! We’ll confirm your booking very soon.”

Automatic Email to Shop Owner

The system sends an email notification to the shop owner with the booking details.

The owner can approve or reject the request directly.

Automatic Response to Client

Once the owner takes action:

If approved → The client receives a confirmation email.

If rejected → The client receives a polite rejection email.

Record Keeping

Every booking (with approval/rejection status) is automatically added to a Google Sheet for easy record management and reporting.
